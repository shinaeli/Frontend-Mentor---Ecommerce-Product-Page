## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learnt how to create overlays.

```css
.modal {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    display: none;
    transition-property: display;
    transition-duration: 8s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    /* border: 2px solid yellow; */
}

.modal::before {
    content: ' ';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: #666;
    opacity: 0.5;
}

.modal-content {
    position: relative;
    width: 35%;
    margin: 20px auto;
    /* border: 2px solid purple; */
}

.previous, .next {
    position: absolute;
    top: 40%;
    margin-left: -30px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 60px;
    /* border: 2px solid red; */
}
```
